# A continually expanding collection of RNA-seq tools

These notes are not intended to be comprehensive. They include notes about methods, packages and tools I would like to explore. For a comprehensive overview of the subject, consider [other bioinformatics resources](https://github.com/mdozmorov/blogs/tree/master/Bioinformatics). Issues with suggestions and pull requests are welcome!

## Quality control

- `MultiQC` - Summarization and visualization QC results for multiple samples in one report. Recognizes multiple QC tools. http://multiqc.info/

- `ngsReports` - An R Package for managing FastQC reports and other NGS related log files. https://github.com/UofABioinformaticsHub/ngsReports, http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/02/313148.abstract


## Clustering

- `clust` - Python package for identification of consistently coexpressed clusters of genes, within and across datasets. Consensus clustering principle. ~50% of genes do not cluster well and thus shouldn't be considered. Compared with seven tools (cross-clustering, k-means, SOMs, MCL, HC, Click, WGCNA) using seven different cluster validation metrics. Outperforms all, produces more focused and significant functional enrichment results. https://github.com/BaselAbujamous/clust
