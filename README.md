## Structural variations

- `SQUID` - transcriptomic structural variation caller. Genome segment graph, then rearrange segments so that as many read alignments as possible are concordant with the rearranged sequence. Compared with MUMmer3, DELLY2, LUMPY in simulated settings, and with SOAPfuse, deFuse, FusionCatcher, JAFFA, INTEGRATE tools using real data. https://github.com/Kingsford-Group/squid
