Testing with Brass list indicates gene symbol, RefSeq and Ensembl ID are supported (Entrez Gene ID not supported).",Enrichment analysis is performed with Fatigo. No clustering. Relies on DAG for term grouping.,Overall network is constructed with SNOW analysis tool.  Network statistics data are provided.,,,"User requests are queued for process.  Enrichment and PPI analyses are done with two separate tools, Fatigo and SNOW, respectively.",Enrichment results are visualized using DAG. Both DAG network and PPI network are visualized using an online graph viewer called CellMap.,Results are downloadable in txt files.,"The web site no longer renders correctly in Chrome, IE, or Firefox.  Our testing was done using Safari on OSX.  The web page states it was optimized for Chrome 36+, our Chrome version is 64. The portal contains additional tools for turning data from specific omics platforms into a gene list."

E.g., gene lists submitted under one analysis can be redirected to other tools for further analysis.",Provides visualization for the overall PPI network.,Results are downloadable in txt files.  Network visualization is available in multiple formats.,"Well integrated with Ensembl, therefore provides updated data content covering a wide range of organisms.

ToppFun,https://toppgene.cchmc.org/,7,"2018, Oct",Support multiple ID types for human.,,"ToppNet uses PPI data source for the purpose of prioritizing genes based on the interaction between an input gene list to a known ""test"" list.  It is not designed to analyze a single gene list.",,,"Clean interface, easy to use.",Enrichment results for each category can be visualized with an interactive bar-line-combo plot.,Results are downloadable in txt files.,"The ToppGene suite contains multiple components. ToppGene and ToppNet prioritize test genes based on a given training gene list, therefore they were not evaluated for our purpose. ToppGeNet sits on top of ToppGene and ToppNet, therefore was not evaluated. We only evaluate the ToppFun component, which implements functional enrichment analysis for a single gene list."

GoEast,http://omicslab.genetics.ac.cn/GOEAST/,9,"2018, Jul",Standard tools are designed to accept predefined microarray identifiers. Batch-Genes tool accepts gene symbols (not Entrez Gene ID) and multiple organisms.,,,,"It analyzes gene list one at a time using GOEAST. However, Multi-GOEAST allows to compare the output of up-to-three analysis results. There is no plan to support more than three result files (based on FAQ), as it relies on three color channels in visualization.","The main inconvenience is that non-array gene lists need to be analyzed through Batch-Genes tool.  Multi-GOEAST only accepts results of Batch-Genes, not integrated.",DAG graph view.,Results are downloadable in txt files.,"The tool is heavily oriented to support array platforms.  To analyze regular gene lists, it requires some research to find the Batch-Gene tools hidden behind the navigation menu."

Based on publication, there is another portal for NetworkTrail, however, the submission was forwarded to GeneTrail2.
